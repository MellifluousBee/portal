a shift employee scheduling and communication web app
I manage the front of house part-time staff of the St Louis Symphony Orchestra.  For years, I have witnessed a very inefficient schedule making
and communicating system.  Schedules are made by hand and emails sent with attachments.  When people change shifts, they must email to inform the
manager who changes their time clock information.  This web app will attempt to serve as a central info distro site to tell staff members what
events are happening and when they are working.  It will provide a one-click way of notifying all those not working a shift that someone is trying 
to give theirs up.  It will also provide an easy way to request off future shifts and input availability and preferences.  On the manager side, it
will allow schedule creation using algorithms that check in order of availability and then preferences to create shift schedules automatically
with a staffing number input.  The prototype will seek to schedule just the bartenders right now. I will use bootstrap to create a very simple
and user-friendly layout.  It might look something like this:

It will also have a singular sign in screen:

All users will come to this basic screen from which they can navigate to a calender, their profile, request off forms, and if they are a manager, to a schedule creation area.

The individual profile page will have this information:
